My professional experience, academic background, and side projects showcase my expertise in applying machine learning research to industry applications. I've successfully navigated high-pressure environments, such as pitching to VPs on a global procurement committee at Schneider Electric, while addressing both business productivity and machine learning challenges.

I'm actively involved in open-source communities like Aleksa Gordic's, Twelve Labs  (Multimodal Minds), and Chip Huyen's (MLOps) ... My research interests include multimodal AI, LLMs, video understanding, AI safety, and reliability.
