* <u>Do hard things</u>.
* Focus on <u>problems that matter</u>. 
* <u>Build fast</u>, test ur hypothesis fast.
* When needed, <u>focus on one thing</u> at once.
* When u do something do it well : <u>excel</u> on it.
* Be more of a <u>listener</u>, being <u>humble</u> and <u>keep learning/growing</u>.
* Challenge urself (<u>whatâ€™s next ? So what ?</u>)

*Two topics : one from hugging face release maybe absence of tokenizer. The other one for enhancing llm knowledge and text to sql accuracy, check Lamini MoME.*
